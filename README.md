# 🕵️ Spot the Scam – Job Fraud Detection

**Spot the Scam** is a machine learning-powered web app that identifies fraudulent job postings based on natural language patterns in job descriptions, requirements, and company profiles.

This project was built as part of the **DS-1 Hackathon (Spot the Scam)** challenge.

> Upload a CSV of job listings and get instant predictions with visual insights.

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Model**: XGBoost Classifier  
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaned + TF-IDF vectorized text (title, description, etc.)
- **Features**: `title`, `company_profile`, `description`, `requirements`, `benefits`
- **Vectorizer**: TF-IDF (bigrams, 10k tokens)
- **Imbalance Handling**: Class weighting (fraud is rare)
- **Metric Focus**: F1 Score (highly imbalanced binary classification)
